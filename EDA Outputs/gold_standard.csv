RET,ret proto-oncogene,9967,"Medullary thyroid carcinoma and Pheochromocytoma are phenotypic features of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A and 2B. They were currently lumped into MEN2A. Men2B is a seperate split curation due to a slightly different molecular mechanism, and phenotypic variability compared to MEN2A, although some reports would consider MEN2A and MEN2B as part of a continuum of disease labelled MEN2. For MEN2A the mechanism if gain of function (GOF), that occurs due to ligand independent receptro dimerization and activation. For MEN2B the gain of function mechanism is due to monomeric activation of the RET receptor and autoactivation of the tyrosine kinase domain.",This curation was perfomed as part of the ACMG59 gene list,Autosomal dominant inheritance,MONDO:0008234,multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A,"['Assertion', 'Molecular mechanism', 'Phenotypic Variability']",lumped,"{'171300': 'Pheochromocytoma', '171400': 'Multiple endocrine neoplasia IIA', '155240': 'Medullary thyroid carcinoma'}",['UNC Biocuration Core']
RET,ret proto-oncogene,9967,"MEN2B, while a multiple endocrine neoplasia, differs from the RET associated MEN2A, as the mechanism for the gain of function is due to monomeric activation of the RET receptor by mutations that induce autoactivation of the kinase domain, versus the ligand recepter independent dimerization and activation observed in MEN2A. Furthermore, the phenotype for MEN2B is considered more severe, and only two variants have been reported (M918T and A883F) which have not been observed in individuals with MEN2A, as they are located in the kinase domain. Therefore this curation has been split.",This curation was performed as part of the ACMG59 gene list.,Autosomal dominant inheritance,MONDO:0008082,multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B,"['Molecular mechanism', 'Phenotypic Variability']",single-omim,{'162300': 'Multiple endocrine neoplasia IIB'},['UNC Biocuration Core']

BPTF,bromodomain PHD finger transcription factor,3581,"During the precuration presentation, several potential disease names were discussed for the BPTF curation. Existing literature and databases utilize the term “Neurodevelopmental Disorder with Dysmorphic Facies and Distal Limb Anomalies” (OMIM:617755). The ID/Autism GCEP felt that a disease term that did not include “distal limb anomalies” would be more appropriate for this curation give that limb findings were variable (included -- 5th finger clinodactyly, broad and short great toes, and sandal gap) and not all probands in the literature had such findings. Additional disease entities including Complex Neurodevelopmental Disorder and Syndromic Intellectual Disability were discussed. The ID/Autism GCEP felt Complex Neurodevelopmental Disorder (MONDO:0100038) was not appropriate based on the multisystem clinical findings—such as microcephaly and dysmorphic features—described in probands in the literature. Ultimately, the ID/Autism GCEP decided to curate BPTF for Syndromic Intellectual Disability (MONDO:0000508) given that this term captures the neurodevelopmental and syndromic findings reported in the literature to date.",,Autosomal dominant inheritance,MONDO:0000508,syndromic intellectual disability,"['Assertion', 'Phenotypic Variability']",single-new,[],['ID-Autism GCEP']
