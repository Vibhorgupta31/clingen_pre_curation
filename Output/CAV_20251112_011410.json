Orphanet separately lists rippling muscle disease, distal myopathy, hyperCKemia, and Romano-Ward syndrome for CAV3."

      "verdict": "Distinct",
      "justification": "Skeletal muscle caveolinopathies commonly show reduced/absent caveolin-3 and dominant-negative behavior, with many mutations leading to loss/mislocalization of CAV3. LQT9 variants show gain-of-function at the level of cardiac sodium current (2–5× increased late INa), indicating a mechanistically distinct channelopathy."

      "verdict": "Variable expressivity",

      "justification": "Most skeletal phenotypes are autosomal dominant with rare autosomal recessive RMD2 families; LQT9 is autosomal dominant; cardiomyopathy is autosomal dominant. Differences in inheritance (presence of AR only in skeletal group) align with phenotype groupings and management distinctions."
