 Description
The RET protooncogene is one of the receptor tyrosine kinases, cell-surface molecules that transduce signals for cell growth and differentiation. The RET gene was defined as an oncogene by a classical transfection assay. RET can undergo oncogenic activation in vivo and in vitro by cytogenetic rearrangement (Grieco et al., 1990). Mutations in the RET gene are associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia, type IIA (MEN2A; 171400), multiple endocrine neoplasia, type IIB (MEN2B; 162300), Hirschsprung disease (HSCR; aganglionic megacolon; 142623), and medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC; 155240). 
Plaza-Menacho et al. (2006) reviewed the genetics and molecular mechanisms underlying the different inherited neural crest-related disorders involving RET dysfunction.
