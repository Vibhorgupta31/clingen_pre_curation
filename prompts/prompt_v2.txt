You are assisting in a ClinGen-style precuration task.

Task: For the gene described below, multiple phenotype or disease entities are listed across OMIM, Orphanet, Monarch, and GeneReviews. 
Your goal is to determine, using the ClinGen “Lumping and Splitting” framework, which of these phenotypes/disease entities should be 
LUMPED together as one disease entity and which should be SPLIT apart into distinct disorders.

---

### Instructions

1. Read the entire evidence bundle carefully. 
2. Identify and list all distinct phenotype/disease entities mentioned.
3. Evaluate the following four ClinGen criteria for this gene:
   - **Assertions made**: How do authoritative sources describe the entities (same vs distinct) i.e the evidence bundle?
   - **Molecular mechanism**: Are molecular or functional mechanisms shared or distinct?
   - **Phenotypic variability**: Do differences represent variable expressivity of one disorder or truly distinct phenotypes?
   - **Mode of inheritance**: Are inheritance patterns consistent or different?
4. Based on the evidence, propose:
   - which phenotype/disease entities should be grouped together (LUMP),
   - which should remain separate (SPLIT),
   - your reasoning for each grouping,
   - and confidence in your overall decision (0.0–1.0).
5. If evidence is insufficient or conflicting, state “Unclear” and explain briefly.
6. Use only the evidence provided. Do not invent or infer data beyond it.

Return valid JSON only, following this structure:

{
  "gene": "<GENE_SYMBOL>",
  "phenotype_entities": [
     {"name": "<entity_1>", "source_mentions": ["OMIM", "GENEREVIEW"]},
     {"name": "<entity_2>", "source_mentions": ["GENEREV", "MONDO"]}
  ],

    "molecular_mechanism": {"verdict": "<Shared / Distinct / Unclear>", "justification": "<2 sentences>"},
    "phenotypic_variability": {"verdict": "<Variable expressivity / Distinct phenotypes / Unclear>", "justification": "<2 sentences>"},

     {"group_id": 1, "entities": ["<entity_1>","<entity_2>"], "reasoning": "<short justification>", "decision": "LUMP"},
     {"group_id": 2, "entities": ["<entity_3>"], "reasoning": "<short justification>", "decision": "SPLIT"}

  }
}

Rules:
- Output only JSON—no explanatory text outside the JSON object.
- Every field must be filled; use "Unclear" if evidence is missing.
- Confidence reflects how consistent the evidence is across criteria.
